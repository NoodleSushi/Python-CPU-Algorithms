# Instructions
1. Ensure that Python 3.11.x is installed and that the python system variable is directed to python.
2. Ensure that you are connected to the internet to install the necessary libraries.
3. Run install.bat to initialize the virtual environment and install the necessary libraries.

## Ways to run the cmd app
1. Run execute.bat to execute the cmd app.

Alternatively, you can run the app manually:
1. Open a command prompt in the same directory as the main.py file.
2. Activate the virtual environment by running the command `.venv\Scripts\activate`.
3. Run the main.py file by running the command `python main.py`.
4. Include the `-h` flag to see help for passing arguments.

## Running CPU Algorithm Samples

To run samples of each CPU algorithm, navigate to the `samples` folder and execute the batch file corresponding to the desired algorithm abbreviation. For example, to run the First-Come, First-Served (FCFS) algorithm, run the `FCFS.bat` file.
